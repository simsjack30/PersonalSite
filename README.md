# Personal Website

This is my personal website, where I showcase my projects, skills, and goals. Feel free to use my site as a template to create your own. Just substitute in your name, skills, goals, and deploy it online!

The project is built with Svelte, SvelteKit, Skeleton UI, hosted on Railway, and deployed on Vercel.

You can visit the live site [here](https://jacksims.dev/)!
